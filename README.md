Custom card enabling [Temperature Heat maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) in Home Assistant. Makes it simple to visualize the temperature data in your Home Assistant, as a heatmap, in a very cool way.

## About this card
  * About trend icon algorithm: icons show the trend of the day compared previous two days. It's not the right way, it's just a naif implementation.
  * About humidity: heatmap scale for humidity is not complete, it's just a POC!
  * About footer labels: footer is in English format, sorry.

## Support
Hey dude! Help me out for a couple of :beers: or a :coffee:!<br/>

If you use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) as-is, this card can be added as a **custom repository**.
(As always, you should be careful with software which lets you pull random code from the Internet and run it)
